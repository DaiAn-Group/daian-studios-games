    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 31, 2026</p>

    <p>
      At <strong>OrbitHop</strong>, we value your privacy. This Privacy Policy
      describes how we handle information in our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      OrbitHop is an arcade game designed for entertainment. We do not collect
      personal information that can directly identify you (such as your name,
      email address, or phone number). However, we use third-party services that
      may collect certain data automatically.
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use the following services to provide and improve the game:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements. AdMob may
        collect device identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID or iOS
        IDFA) and usage data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Used for game analytics and error
        reporting (Crashlytics). This helps us understand game performance and
        fix bugs. Firebase may collect installation UUIDs and technical device
        information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      OrbitHop is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a
      parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
      personal information, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Game progress (High Scores, Star Dust, Unlocked Skins) is stored locally on
      your device. If you delete the app, this data may be lost. Analytics data
      collected by third parties is handled according to their respective
      retention policies.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
